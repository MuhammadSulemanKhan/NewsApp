It includes the use of all types of arts, methods, materials, skills, principles, and instruments of science, psychology, and technology. It can be used to arrange and control the learning conditions required to achieve educational technical objectives. Just as science and technology help us to do more work with less energy and effort in our daily life, in the same way educational technology controls the waste of energy and time in the teaching process. It also lays emphasis on the development of appropriate evaluation methods for measuring behavior change and for checking the results of the teaching process. After the evaluation process, by examining the final behavior of the students, emphasis is also given to providing the expected reinforcement and support required.
